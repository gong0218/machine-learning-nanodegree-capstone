## I. Definition

### Project Overview
Sales forecasting is very important for retail business. An accurate sales forecast helps companies to
* Understand companys' performance / customer demand
* Change strategy for the companys' growth
* Conduct beneficial Marketing promotion
* Conduct better management of Inventory
* Adjust price adequately

Many factors, such as, Past sales result / Seasonality / Marketing promotion effect / Consumer Behavior / Price / Competitors' situation / weather / Economic indicators may affect sales forecasting result. There are also many methodologies for time series forecast [1, 2]. Companies need to identify important factors and select an adequate methodology for an accurate sales forecasting.

In this project, I created machine learning models for time series sales forecast. I used the histrical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions.

### Problem Statement
Walmart Inc. is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores. It is the world's largest company by revenue and the largest private employer in the world.

In their kaggle competition[(Walmart Store Sales Forecasting)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data), they provide historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments. The objective of this competition is to project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact.

This is a typical time series problem. General time series modeling framework(e.g. ETS, ARIMA), Gradient Boosting framework(e.g. xgboost), and Neural Network framework(e.g. LSTM) are expected to be potential solutions.

### Metrics
I used the weighted mean absolute error (WMAE) as evaluation metric.

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?WMAE%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csum%20w_%7Bi%7D%7D%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%20%7Bw_%7Bi%7D%7D%5Cleft%20%7C%20%7By_%7Bi%7D%7D%20-%20%5Cwidehat%7By_%7Bi%7D%7D%20%5Cright%20%7C)

where

n is the number of rows
ŷ i is the predicted sales
yi is the actual sales
wi are weights. w = 5 if the week is a holiday week, 1 otherwise

By using the WMAE metric, I can select an accurate model for holiday seasons' sales that is especially important for Walmart.

## II. Analysis

### Data Exploration
The dataset provided by the kaggle competition.
[(Walmart Store Sales Forecasting)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data)
includes historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions.

**stores.csv**

This file contains anonymized information about the 45 stores, indicating the type and size of store.

**train.csv / test.csv**

Train data is the historical weekly data, which covers to 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01. Within this file you will find the following fields:

* Store - the store number
* Dept - the department number
* Date - the week
* Weekly_Sales -  sales for the given department in the given store
* IsHoliday - whether the week is a special holiday week

Test data is the historical weekly data, which covers to 2012-11-02 to 2013-08-02, with the same fields except for sales.

**features.csv**

This file contains additional data related to the store, department, and regional activity for the given dates. It contains the following fields:

* Store - the store number
* Date - the week
* Temperature - average temperature in the region
* Fuel_Price - cost of fuel in the region
* MarkDown1-5 - anonymized data related to promotional markdowns that Walmart is running. MarkDown data is only available after Nov 2011, and is not available for all stores all the time. Any missing value is marked with an NA.
* CPI - the consumer price index
* Unemployment - the unemployment rate
* IsHoliday - whether the week is a special holiday week

### Exploratory Visualization
In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that summarizes or extracts a relevant characteristic or feature about the data. The visualization should adequately support the data being used. Discuss why this visualization was chosen and how it is relevant. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you visualized a relevant characteristic or feature about the dataset or input data?_
- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_
- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_

### Algorithms and Techniques
In this section, you will need to discuss the algorithms and techniques you intend to use for solving the problem. You should justify the use of each one based on the characteristics of the problem and the problem domain. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are the algorithms you will use, including any default variables/parameters in the project clearly defined?_
- _Are the techniques to be used thoroughly discussed and justified?_
- _Is it made clear how the input data or datasets will be handled by the algorithms and techniques chosen?_

### Benchmark
In this section, you will need to provide a clearly defined benchmark result or threshold for comparing across performances obtained by your solution. The reasoning behind the benchmark (in the case where it is not an established result) should be discussed. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Has some result or value been provided that acts as a benchmark for measuring performance?_
- _Is it clear how this result or value was obtained (whether by data or by hypothesis)?_


## III. Methodology
_(approx. 3-5 pages)_

### Data Preprocessing
In this section, all of your preprocessing steps will need to be clearly documented, if any were necessary. From the previous section, any of the abnormalities or characteristics that you identified about the dataset will be addressed and corrected here. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _If the algorithms chosen require preprocessing steps like feature selection or feature transformations, have they been properly documented?_
- _Based on the **Data Exploration** section, if there were abnormalities or characteristics that needed to be addressed, have they been properly corrected?_
- _If no preprocessing is needed, has it been made clear why?_

### Implementation
In this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented. It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is it made clear how the algorithms and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data?_
- _Were there any complications with the original metrics or techniques that required changing prior to acquiring a solution?_
- _Was there any part of the coding process (e.g., writing complicated functions) that should be documented?_

### Refinement
In this section, you will need to discuss the process of improvement you made upon the algorithms and techniques you used in your implementation. For example, adjusting parameters for certain models to acquire improved solutions would fall under the refinement category. Your initial and final solutions should be reported, as well as any significant intermediate results as necessary. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Has an initial solution been found and clearly reported?_
- _Is the process of improvement clearly documented, such as what techniques were used?_
- _Are intermediate and final solutions clearly reported as the process is improved?_


## IV. Results
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Model Evaluation and Validation
In this section, the final model and any supporting qualities should be evaluated in detail. It should be clear how the final model was derived and why this model was chosen. In addition, some type of analysis should be used to validate the robustness of this model and its solution, such as manipulating the input data or environment to see how the model’s solution is affected (this is called sensitivity analysis). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is the final model reasonable and aligning with solution expectations? Are the final parameters of the model appropriate?_
- _Has the final model been tested with various inputs to evaluate whether the model generalizes well to unseen data?_
- _Is the model robust enough for the problem? Do small perturbations (changes) in training data or the input space greatly affect the results?_
- _Can results found from the model be trusted?_

### Justification
In this section, your model’s final solution and its results should be compared to the benchmark you established earlier in the project using some type of statistical analysis. You should also justify whether these results and the solution are significant enough to have solved the problem posed in the project. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are the final results found stronger than the benchmark result reported earlier?_
- _Have you thoroughly analyzed and discussed the final solution?_
- _Is the final solution significant enough to have solved the problem?_


## V. Conclusion
_(approx. 1-2 pages)_

### Free-Form Visualization
In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that emphasizes an important quality about the project. It is much more free-form, but should reasonably support a significant result or characteristic about the problem that you want to discuss. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you visualized a relevant or important quality about the problem, dataset, input data, or results?_
- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_
- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_

### Reflection
In this section, you will summarize the entire end-to-end problem solution and discuss one or two particular aspects of the project you found interesting or difficult. You are expected to reflect on the project as a whole to show that you have a firm understanding of the entire process employed in your work. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you thoroughly summarized the entire process you used for this project?_
- _Were there any interesting aspects of the project?_
- _Were there any difficult aspects of the project?_
- _Does the final model and solution fit your expectations for the problem, and should it be used in a general setting to solve these types of problems?_

### Improvement
In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?_
- _Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?_
- _If you used your final solution as the new benchmark, do you think an even better solution exists?_
