## Proposal
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Domain Background
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide brief details on the background information of the domain from which the project is proposed. Historical information relevant to the project should be included. It should be clear how or why a problem in the domain can or should be solved. Related academic research should be appropriately cited in this section, including why that research is relevant. Additionally, a discussion of your personal motivation for investigating a particular problem in the domain is encouraged but not required.

### Problem Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe the problem that is to be solved. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Datasets and Inputs

I will use the dataset provided by the kaggle competition.
[(Walmart Store Sales Forecasting)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data)

**stores.csv**

This file contains anonymized information about the 45 stores, indicating the type and size of store.

**train.csv / test.csv**

Train data is the historical weekly data, which covers to 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01. Within this file you will find the following fields:

Store - the store number
Dept - the department number
Date - the week
Weekly_Sales -  sales for the given department in the given store
IsHoliday - whether the week is a special holiday week

Test data is the historical weekly data, which covers to 2012-11-02 to 2013-08-02, with the same fields except for sales.

**features.csv**

This file contains additional data related to the store, department, and regional activity for the given dates. It contains the following fields:

Store - the store number
Date - the week
Temperature - average temperature in the region
Fuel_Price - cost of fuel in the region
MarkDown1-5 - anonymized data related to promotional markdowns that Walmart is running. MarkDown data is only available after Nov 2011, and is not available for all stores all the time. Any missing value is marked with an NA.
CPI - the consumer price index
Unemployment - the unemployment rate
IsHoliday - whether the week is a special holiday week

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics

We use the weighted mean absolute error (WMAE) as evaluation metric.

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?WMAE%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csum%20w_%7Bi%7D%7D%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%20%7Bw_%7Bi%7D%7D%5Cleft%20%7C%20%7By_%7Bi%7D%7D%20-%20%5Cwidehat%7By_%7Bi%7D%7D%20%5Cright%20%7C)

where

n is the number of rows
yÌ‚ i is the predicted sales
yi is the actual sales
wi are weights. w = 5 if the week is a holiday week, 1 otherwise

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.

-----------

**Before submitting your proposal, ask yourself. . .**

- Does the proposal you have written follow a well-organized structure similar to that of the project template?
- Is each section (particularly **Solution Statement** and **Project Design**) written in a clear, concise and specific fashion? Are there any ambiguous terms or phrases that need clarification?
- Would the intended audience of your project be able to understand your proposal?
- Have you properly proofread your proposal to assure there are minimal grammatical and spelling mistakes?
- Are all the resources used for this project correctly cited and referenced?
